# compose_practice

a general sample of the projects i am up to date on.

1. CryptocurrencyAppYT: following the youtube tutorial that was suggested
2. coinListOnly: following the YT tutorial, but only implimenting half of the code
3. BasicsCodelab: following the codelab online
4. LoginSystem: this is an attempt to use what i learned in the YT tutorial, but to modify it for a basic crud login system.
   didnt get too far because i needed a backend.
